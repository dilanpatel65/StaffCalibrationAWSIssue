Using the ``model``, ``form``, ``view``, ``url``, and ``template`` logics for the **Staff** pages - *create* and *update*, create the pages for the **StaffType** and **DigitalLevel** to allow the users to add and update records of their digital levels and staff types. 

In this Staff Calibration project, **StaffType** parameters are allowed to be created or edited by only members of the Survey Services/Geodetic group.

Check the **staff/staffs/** folder to see the models, views and templates and how ``admin.py`` and ``urls.py`` are constructed for various views and how templates are designed.
