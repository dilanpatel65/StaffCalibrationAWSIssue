Overview
========

Staff calibration is a django-based web application designed for Landgate and other external users such as surveyors and engineers who are engaged in measuring absolute or relative height differences on the ground, to calibrate levelling staves online and get the reports instantly. This application replaces the existing 'staff' software (executable written in Delphi) provided by Landgate. Written in python, html, css and some javascripts, this new application:

* is mathematically more robust by considering the signifcant seasonal variation in range,
* users have more control over their own levelling instruments and manage their staff calibration records, and
* has the ability to do both range and staff calibrations, which is very important for Landgate who manages the Boya Range,
